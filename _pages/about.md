I am passionate about building intelligent systems that can achieve superhuman performance through planning and intelligent exploration. With dual degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Pittsburgh and a Master's in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, I bridge theoretical foundations with practical engineering.

My experience spans deep learning research and scalable system design, with a focus on:
- Deep reinforcement learning, world models, and planning
- Distributed systems, software architecture, and implementation

I am joining AWS as a software engineer in April 2025, and I'm always eager to collaborate on interesting problems that push the boundaries of AI systems. Please feel free to reach out or connect!
